SOME IDEAS FOR THE PROJECT


1. use attributes for creatures
- name
- gender
- parents [Object Creature]
- stats [Object Stat]
- experiences [int]
- type
- items

creatures can have problems in a random time


2. stats have many attributes
- heredity [strict,non-strict,none]
 - strict means both need this stat
 - non-strict means only one need this
 - none means it not hereditary
- effect (eg: will grow faster and stronger)
